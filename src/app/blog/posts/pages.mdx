## Introduction

Over the past few years, I've had the opportunity to work independently with founders, startups, and businesses worldwide — building everything from SaaS platforms and marketplaces to LMS systems, booking apps, and powerful real-time chat applications.

Each project has sharpened my skills in building production-ready, scalable, and efficient solutions across both frontend and backend systems.

## Core Lessons from Real-World Projects

- **User Experience First**: No matter how good your code is, users stay because of experience. I always focus on fast, intuitive, and responsive design using modern libraries like Tailwind CSS, Material UI, and ShadCN.
- **Backend Strength**: Scalability matters from day one. With tools like Node.js, Express.js, NestJS, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, I ensure architectures are ready to handle real growth — not just MVPs.
- **Speed & Real-time Features**: Real-time chat, live notifications, tracking, wallet integrations, and even payment splits — users expect more, and I deliver beyond the basics.

## Why I Do It

Helping founders and businesses go from an *idea* to a *launched product* — and seeing their vision turn into a success story — is what drives me every day. Platforms like LinkedIn, Upwork, and personal referrals have connected me with incredible people and projects, and I’m excited to keep building, scaling, and solving problems with great teams around the world.
