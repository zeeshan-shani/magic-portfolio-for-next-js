## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For building fast, server-side rendered e-commerce web apps.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was handling real-time inventory across multiple franchises without any lag. To solve this, we implemented scalable database structures and optimized API response times. Additionally, ensuring a smooth checkout experience across multiple payment providers required in-depth handling of edge cases and security protocols.

BuyBack successfully launched as a highly scalable e-commerce solution. It now powers multiple franchises, supports thousands of products, and delivers a seamless customer experience. The platform has improved client retention and boosted online sales, providing a robust foundation for future growth.
